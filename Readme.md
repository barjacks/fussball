# Automated gathering, analysis and visualization of European Football Data

#Summary v.1.0
- Develop a scraper to show how Swiss Super League tranfers in season 16/17
compare
- Make it reproduceable so the scraper could be extended to other leagues.

##Â Tools
- Using BeautifulSoup for the scraping, Pandas for the graphs and a few little
last tweaks with Adobe Illustrator.

## Source
- The multilingual Football stat site transfermarkt.com. Using the Swiss Domain,
transfermarkt.ch to scrape. This is important because text elements in the code
are in German, on the .com site in German.
